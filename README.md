# Welcome Traverler to YgoCCv2!

To get a general understanding of what this is, this is a Yugioh Card Collecting Program. Designed for easy use and portability across all platforms. 

Not only can this program be used to store your collection of Cards such as the edition, price, quantity and location of said card, it can also look for current prices of your card online, pull up images of the card, possibly even be a marketplace of its own for selling and trading cards!

Using a Server to Client database, our card database is stored on the web where you can access it using our YgoCC which is a Client side program. All YgoCC does is display a fancy, easy to use Gui(WIP) and enter a card name to then have that data sent to our Server where it will find similarities to what card your looking for, returning the result in a List of Monster, Extra Monsters, Spells and Traps!

This makes the Program Lightweight and quick to run. And if you happen to not be around internet, all cards that contain saved data listed above, get saved Locally to your machine and can be accessed without the use of the Internet. Not to mention, the server will even contain a copy of all your card data you have saved, which means that across all the multiple platforms you have, you can access your database and have it syncronized anywhere!
